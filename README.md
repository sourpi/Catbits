# Catbits
This is an educational quantum game for QJam2021. A (schrodinger's) cat is trying to escape from a box alive. We map qubit state |0> / |1> to cat dead/alive state. Cat can alter her state by entering qunatum gate-doors. In order to stay alive,she has to figure out the correct order of gates without getting caught by villain cameras that can distrurb her state (measurement).
